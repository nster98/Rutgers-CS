# Computer Science Classes

## Data Structures
**Course Code: 198:112**    
Course designed around different data structures and their applications  
**Languages**
* Java


## Computer Architecture
**Course Code: 198:211**    
Course designed around the inner workings of computers at machine level, using C, Assembly, and other essential parts of computers  
**Languages**
* C
* Assembly


## Systems Programming
**Course Code: 198:214**

This course teaches students how to think about, build, debug, and test large computer programs. The course stresses learning how to use tools such as debuggers, profilers, source version control systems, and integrated development environments as an essential part of developing large programs. The course also stresses the understanding of how programs execute on today's computers and how to measure and optimize performance. Programming will be in C on Unix systems to introduce students to a new programming eco system, as well as enable the mapping of high-level language constructs to the underlying machine.

**Languages**
* C
* Unix based control

## Internet Technology
**Course Code: 198:352**

To provide a practical understanding of computer networks with respect to system architectures, protocols, and client-server interaction.  These objectives are accomplished through extensive laboratory exercises.

**Languages**
* Python
* Mininet / Bash

# Computer Engineering Classes

## Intro to Computer Systems
**Course Code: 332:434**

The course covers the fundamental principles of modern multi core computer systems. In particular, it introduces the four main components of multi core computer systems in managing the processor, memory, secondary/tertiary storage and other I/O devices.

**Languages**
* C

## Software Engineering
**Course Code: 332:452**

The key objective of this course is to learn modular design of software and describe the design using symbolic representations (UML diagrams). The course covers software life-cycle models and different phases of software development process.
The course focuses on team-based, hands-on development of demonstrable software, which requires a great deal of programming. However, this is not a programming course and does not teach any particular programming language. Students are assumed to have solid programming knowledge and are ready to learn best practices and ideas about software development. An ideal background knowledge includes a traditional programming language, such as Java, C++, or C#, and Web programming languages, such as PHP and JavaScript, as well as relational database programming (using SQL).
