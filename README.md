## Data Structures
**Course Code: 198:112**    
Course designed around different data structures and their applications  
**Languages**
* Java


## Computer Architecture
**Course Code: 198:211**    
Course designed around the inner workings of computers at machine level, using C, Assembly, and other essential parts of computers  
**Languages**
* C
* Assembly


## Systems Programming
**Course Code: 198:214**

This course teaches students how to think about, build, debug, and test large computer programs. The course stresses learning how to use tools such as debuggers, profilers, source version control systems, and integrated development environments as an essential part of developing large programs. The course also stresses the understanding of how programs execute on today's computers and how to measure and optimize performance. Programming will be in C on Unix systems to introduce students to a new programming eco system, as well as enable the mapping of high-level language constructs to the underlying machine.

**Languages**
* C
* Unix based control

## Internet Technology
To provide a practical understanding of computer networks with respect to system architectures, protocols, and client-server interaction.  These objectives are accomplished through extensive laboratory exercises.

**Languages**
* Python
* Mininet / Bash
